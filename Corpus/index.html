    <h3> Conclusion</h3>
    <p>BLE is a radio protocol meant for PAN. Good for devices that stay in close proximity to each other. It is not ideal for devices that are separated by more than a few meters away from each other.
Zigbee is a better option for our needs. Considering ZigBee's almost instant network join time it is more suitable for our project needs as well as its support for large-scale automation purposes. The trade-off that had to be considered was ZigBee's higher power consumption than BLE, however, given our project scenario, this trade-off can be afforded.

    <p>One of the first challenges when working on requirements from the client was to understand users of the system, what they are responsible for when working on field and how much access they are allowed to scientifically important data</p>
    <p>As per conversation with the client there will be 3 types of system users:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Field staff-Input Data, but not export</li> 
    <li>Coordinators-Input data and export reports</li>
    <li>Higher Level Staff-Export Basic reports but not input or edit data</li>
    </ul>    
     
    <h3>Interaction with client</h3>    
        
    <table id="lofitable1" border="0">
    <tr>
    <td id="img"><img src="Phase2/understandusers.png" width="350" height="500"></td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Based on answers from client it was decided to build system that work on principle of least privilege (POLP). Instead of assigning each user to particular role, each user will be granted with list of privileges based on their role. </p>
    <p>List of privileges:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Read (Can only view data)</li>
    <li>Create (Can add new data into system)</li>
    <li>Edit (Can modify existing information)</li>
    <li>Export (Can export reports)</li>
    <li>Admin (Has all of the above)</li>
    </ul>
        
    <p>In addition, Admins are able to register new users, assign privileges, modify users and delete users. Admins can delete other Admins which is needed in case people are no longer working on the research.
    </p>
        
    <h2 id="stories"> User Stories <button><a href="#title">Back to Top </a></button></h2>     
    
    <p> To get better understanding of user requirements and system functionality we have written users stories to describe different features of the system.</p>
    <h3> System Setup</h3>  
    <ol>
        <li>As a researcher, I can attach a tag to a bird and keep track of the tag ID, enabling me to register the bird in the system.</li>
        <li>As a technician, I can setup the network linking feeders and the central hub. This allows me to install hardware and software components of the system from scratch.</li>       
    </ol>
    <h3>System Usability</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>As a user, I can log into the system using my username and password</li>   
    <li>As a user, I can log out of the system locking my account. For the system to be used again, the next user needs to enter their own username / password.</li>
    <li>As a user with privileges to add information into the system, I can register a tagged bird in the system. This allows the system to track the bird visits to feeders and store this data into database.</li>
    <li>As a user with privileges to edit data, I can edit data about a bird registered in the system to update a bird's details (such as status, condition etc.).</li>
    <li>As a user with privileges to view data, I can view any data held about birds.</li>
    <li>As a user with privileges to export data, I can filter the report before viewing/exporting it so that it shows only fields I am interested in. This allows me to narrow down the dataset to only relevant subjects.</li>
    <li>As a user with admin privileges, I can register a new user and assign them with appropriate privileges. This ensures that each user of the system has the minimal amount of access required to carry out their duties without compromising additional functionality of the system.</li>    
    <li>As a user with view privileges I want to see the most relevant data about birds first such as: Individual ID, Name, Sex, Male parent, Female parent, Age, Breeder or Non-Breeder, Nest site from the previous breeding season, Nest site distance to hopper.</li>
    </ol>   
    <h3>System Maintenance</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>As a technician, I can update the system with a patch issued by the development team. This allows me to keep the system up-to-date and prevent software bugs and vulnerabilities from hampering normal operation.</li>   
    <li>As a user with any type of privileges, I am notified if any part of the system is suspected to be non-functional (such as a broken communications link). This allows me to detect errors faster and recover while minimizing data loss.</li>
    <li>As user with any type of privileges, I can restart any part the system after a power / other failure to return it to an operational state.</li>
    </ol>
        
    <h3>New User stories based on interaction with the client</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>As a user with admin privileges, I can view a log of significant actions taken by other users of the system, such as registering a bird, connecting a feeder etc. This helps me troubleshoot and identify errors made by other team members, as well as to detect any unusual activity.</li>    
    <li>As a user with any type of privileges I want to add list of new unassigned rings to the system.</li>
    <li>As a user with any type of privileges I want to keep track of assigned and unassigned rings.</li>
    </ol>    
    
        
    <h2 id="lofi1"> Lo-Fi Design 1 <button><a href="#title">Back to Top </a></button></h2> 
    <p>The first version of Lo-Fi prototype was created using myBalsamiq tool. The idea of the first prototype was to decide on basic layout for buttons and how data will be displayed on the screen.  </p>       
    <p> First list of requirements listed by client includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Register new birds</li>
        <li>Register new nest sites</li>
        <li>View database with all bird data</li>
        <li>Create reports</li>
        <li>Search information</li>
        <li>Live View (This functionality was proposed by us and it was approved by client as it would be useful for researchers to see which birds and how often are visiting feeders.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Second version of Lo-Fi prototype and all the following versions were created using Google Slides. In second version we have changed layout of the home screen and decided to locate all menu options to the left side as it allows users to navigate through the application without going back to main menu screen. 
    Version 2 of Lo-Fi design shows 2 different options of Live View. First option displays all data entries in a large table. This view does not include filters and pagination and hence is not user friendly especially when dealing with large amounts of data. In second version we have added filters and pagination. This will enable users to easily navigate through large amounts of data, search for information using search bar at the top and pick specific bird visit times using time filter.</p>    
    <br>
    <table id="lofitable1" border="0">

    <h2 id="hifi1"> Hi-Fi Design 1 <button><a href="#title">Back to Top </a></button></h2>
    <p> This version of UI design was created once we decided that for system development, we will be using sails.js web application framework which supports large number of user-friendly UI features. The priority was to concentrate on displaying data in Live View, in Single Bird View and Bird Table view. Based on this, other parts of the system can be constructed in the same way to create consistent UI throughout the whole system.</p>
    <h3> Live View</h3>
    <p>In order to display as much information as possible we decided to locate drop-down menu at the top of the page in the left corner which freed up the space to display more information on the screen. More sophisticated time filters were added in order to find specific bird visit times. Users can search for birds by typing their name in the search box. Pagination bar in the footer enables users to navigate through large amount of data more easily. If users wanted to view full information about bird that showed up on the live view they can press 'View' button at the end of the row and it would open new view with bird information.   
    </p>    
    <table id="lofitable1" border="0">
    <tr>
    <td id="img"> Live View Version 3 </td>
    <td id="img"> Live View Version 3 with Menu </td>
    </tr>
        
    <tr>
    <td id="img"><img src="Phase3/hifiliveview1.png" width="400" height="200"></td>
    <td id="img"><img src="Phase3/hifiliveview2.png" width="400" height="200"></td>
    </tr>
    </table>
        
    <p>This version of 'Live View' has been modified number of times. Table has been moved to centre. First column has been removed to avoid unnecessary information on the screen as it does not serve any purpose for researchers.  Menu has been moved to the top right corner and 'Live View' button has been added so that users can always return to live screen from any view. 'View' button at the end of each row has been also removed as we decided that this option can be replaced with different functionality such as pressing on the table entry. This made Live View less cluttered from unnecessary buttons. </p> 
        
    <p>We also had to decide on the ways of showing users when visits have been registered in the system. If new visits were added automatically, it would distract users from viewing Live View, therefore system was developed in the way that it would inform users that new visits were registered and advice users to refresh the page.</p>   
        
    <table id="lofitable1" border="0">

    </table>       
        
        
    <h3> Single Bird View</h3>    
    <p>One of the ways to view single bird information is by clicking on 'View' button from Live View screen. All data is aligned to centre and buttons are added to expand more information about birds such as: Parent information, More information and table with past visits. 'Edit' button in the footer allows to edit information in this view.</p>    
    
    <table id="lofitable1" border="0">
    <tr>

    </tr>        
    </table>   
    
        
    <p>Single Bird view has also been modified. Instead of arranging all data in one column, decision has been made to display information in two columns. This enables users to see more data on the screen. 'Export' button has been added in the footer to export information about one bird as requested by the client, however this function has been removed at the later stage after user testing as researcher advised that this function will not be used. </p>

    <h3>Contrast checker</h3>    
    <p>Following first UI prototype test, client agreed to chosen colour scheme for the system. However, chosen colours failed contrast checker criteria.</p>

    <p>To meet usability standard, colours had to be modified. As client already agreed to chosen colours scheme, we decided to use same colours, but modify shades and brightness. Pictures below show that new colours have passed the contrast checker criteria.</p>
